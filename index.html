          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>As an accomplished executive, I have experience in nearly every facet of technology. My career has focused in the areas of overall IT leadership, large scale / complex project and program management, and IT consulting and consulting management.  I am well versed in the disciplines and methodologies of IT governance including Agile development and planning, strategic planning, project management, infrastructure management, software development, and security controls.  I have managed teams of eight to over one hundred. I thrive in recovery or startup situations where the underlying foundation of IT delivery has either not been effective or is in early development.  I am decidedly challenge oriented and looking for a culture well suited to my highly motivated, creative, and self-managing work style. 
            <br><br>
            I have a direct and frank yet tactful and diplomatic communication style and an executive presence. My foundation is a focus on people and process first and technology second, with a belief that as technologists we cannot realistically anticipate the exact nature of future challenges. The only sustainable strategic advantage is a strong, confident, cohesive, and technically competent team. I have successfully created several high-performance teams through a focus on developing staff, building collaboration and trust, and setting incremental goals. Because my passion is leading people to accomplish great things, I foster a team environment of courage, honesty, trust, as well as deep technical skill and aptitude. I was indoctrinated in teamwork and leadership through the unparalleled team building of the United States Marine Corps.
